subject: Third spoof attempt
Hi Professor - Matt Schreiber again.  Not sure the first two emails
made it through, as my little spoofing script keeps throwing errors
related to the contents of the subject line being interpreted as 
commands by the 'expect' program.  Anyway, hopefully this one gets
through!
