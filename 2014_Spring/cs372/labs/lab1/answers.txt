Part II.

1.  I found the option controlling the number of packets sent by consulting
    ping's manpage.
2.  ping returns:
        a.  A series of messages showing the number of bytes received from the
            pinged host, the hostname and IP address, the icmp_seq representing
            the current ordinal value of the ping (i.e. 1 for the first, 2 for
            the second, etc.), the TTL value representing 'the maximum number
            of IP routers that the packet can go through before being thrown
            away' (from the ping manpage), and the 'network round-trip time',
            which I gather is the time it takes from when the packet is sent to
            when sending host receives a response.
        b.  A group of statistics containing the number of packets transmitted,
            the number of packets received, the percentage of packets lost, and
            the round-trip time, as well as the minimum, average, and maximum
            round-trips times and the maximum deviation from the average
            round-trip time.
3.  I pinged the host rcn.com (my ISP), which translated to
    blaster.web.rcn.net, with IP address 207.172.156.182.  The average
    round-trip time was 85.829 milliseconds, and 0% of the packets were lost.
4.  Please consult the Perl script host-scraper for my method of collecting
    ping statistics and the file pings.txt for output.  A sampling of the
    statistics collected follows:
        a.  For lg.telmexchile.cl, a host in Chile, the average round-trip took
            237.900 milliseconds and there was 0% packet loss.  For
            tacacs-afl.skyvision.net, a host in Somalia, the average round-trip
            took 190.084 milliseconds and there was 0% packet loss.  For
            plaxosprd01.pla.dc.xo.com, a host in Thailand, the average
            round-trip too 50.164 milliseconds and there was 0% packet loss.
